Children's taste preferences drive food choices,,,,,,,
"I cook according to the preferences of my two children, my husband and I will follow and my mom is vegetarian. The meals depend on whether my children will eat it. If I cook my own ideal meal, but my children don't want to eat it, then it's useless. (ID 102_R1)",,,,,,,
"Adults and children have different tastes. Adults are easier, simple dishes are ok, but we have to follow children to make them eat. This is not like before, when children had to follow the adults. Children nowadays are very different, they will never eat what they don't like, and we cannot force them to eat. (ID397_R1)",,,,,,,
"I have to make sure that all the food is delicious, they [referring to children] need to absorb the nutrients. People crave for ingredients their body needs. (ID362-R1)",,,,,,,
