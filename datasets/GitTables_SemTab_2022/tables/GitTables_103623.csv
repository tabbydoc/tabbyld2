[1] Freshly added. Yes, have this one? --jetz.walter Monday, August 15, 2011 1:15:27 PM,,,,,,,
[2] WJ: would the same comment you made re eventDate in MOLSourceFields apply here?,,,,,,,,,,
 --jetz.walter Monday, August 15, 2011 1:13:20 PM,,,,,,,,
[3] how about just a string type (e.g.," ""native"" instead of 1)",,,,,,,,,
WJ: That would be fine," but takes up more space. We could have very consistent numbering here and just display meaning of a number (""native"") in UI. We'd want this field to be searchable.",,,,,,,,,
[4] how about just a string type (e.g.," ""extant"" instead of 1)",,,,,,,,,
WJ: See Origin.,,,,,,,,,,
[5] how about just a string type (e.g.," ""resident"" instead of 1)",,,,,,,,,
WJ: Suggested short ints for space saving, eas(ier) database joins,,,,,,,,,
[6] is this id for joining on another file?,,,,,,,,,,
WJ: yes, for others or, later, MOL,,,,,,,
