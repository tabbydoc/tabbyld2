Most of this research is based on macro-botanical and faunal remains analysis. As an additional line of evidence for the growing body of botanical and faunal data, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in bone collagen were analyzed from 82 human and faunal samples from the Arkansas basin and Ozark Highlands in eastern Oklahoma. The research investigates the role of maize in diets through time and across sex and status dimensions. Spanning six phases, within the time range 300 B.C. to A.D. 1650, mean Î´13C values increase from -19.2 to -12.7 parts per million (%o). Although present prior to A.D. 1000 substantial increases in the use of maize do not begin until the Harlan phase (A.D. 1050-1250). Even with increased use, maize never dominates the diet to the extent seen in Mississippian period sites farther east.",,archaeological evidence; diet; fauna; isotopic analysis; stable isotope; Arkansas; Louisiana; Oklahoma [United States]; Texas; United States; Zea mays,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959946117

Reexamination of the data from Nagle reaffirms that this was principally a cemetery from a currently unidentified village, whereas previously unanalyzed materials from the Allcorn site suggest that this was a Caddoan village with associated cemetery. Radiocarbon dates from the Nagle site and relative dating of diagnostic materials from Allcorn suggest an occupation around A.D. 1200, toward the end of the Harlan phase or perhaps the beginning of the Norman phase. More in-depth analysis of materials from the two sites as well as surrounding Plains Village settlements do not support a previous argument that Arkansas River basin Caddoans in central Oklahoma were traders. It is argued that the presence of these Caddoan people was probably more related to religious and political practices. Final comments address the complexity of their living on what represented the western periphery of the Caddoan area.",Plains/Caddoan interaction; Prestige goods; Religious/political migration,,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857075929
