EA,Ethnographic Atlas,"The Ethnographic Atlas (EA) describes cultural practices for 1291 societies, ranging from societies with complex agricultural economies and political systems to small hunter-gatherer groups. The societies are globally distributed with especially good coverage of Africa and western North America.

Binford,Binford Hunter-Gatherer,"Binford Hunter-Gatherer dataset describes cultural practices for 339 hunter-gatherer groups. Approximately two-thirds of the societies described by Binford are also described in the EA. However, the Binford database includes a number of societies not in the EA, including many in Australia and northern North America.

SCCS,Standard cross-cultural sample,"The Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS) describes a subset of 186 societies that also appear in the EA. These 186 societies were chosen by George P. Murdock, the creator of the dataset, with the goal of maximizing independence among societies. The societies are globally distributed. Since the first installment of the SCCS was published by Murdock and Morrow in 1970, many others have followed, each typically focused on a particular theme (e.g., childhood, kinship systems). Over 2000 cultural variables have now been coded for the 186 societies in the SCCS.

WNAI,Western North American Indian database,"The Western North American Indians (WNAI) dataset describes cultural practices for 172 societies in Western North America. There is significant overlap between the societies described in the WNAI and those in the other three datasets, however the WNAI includes approximately 20 societies not described in the other datasets.
