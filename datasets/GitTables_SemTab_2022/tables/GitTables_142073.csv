Provenance Domain,Inheritance/derivation,derived_from,0,"If the object is derived from another, this field will specify the parent object, in the form of the objectid. It is null, if inherits only from the base BioCompute Object or a type definition."
Provenance Domain,Obsolescence,obsolete,1,If the object has an expiration date this field will specify that using the datetime type.
Provenance Domain,Embargo,embargo,1,"If the object has a period of time that it is not public, that range can be specified using these fields. Using the datetime type a start and end time are specified for the embargo."
Provenance Domain,Created,created,0,Using the datetime type the time of initial creation of the BCO is recorded.
Provenance Domain,Modification,modified,0,Using the datetime type the time of most recent modification of the BCO is recoded.
Provenance Domain,Contributors,contributors,0,"List to hold contributor identifiers and a description of their type of contribution, including a field for ORCIDs to record author information, as they allow for the author to curate their information after submission."

Usability Domain,Usability Domain,usability_domain,0,Provides a space for the author to define the usability domain of the BCO. It is an array of free text values. This field is to aid in search-ability and provide a specific description of the object. It helps determine when and how the BCO can be used.
Extension Domain,Extension Domain,extension_domain,0,For a user to add more structured information that is defined in the type definition. This section is not evaluated by checks for BCO validity or computational correctness.
Extension Domain,Extension to External References: SMART on FHIR Genomics,Extension to External References: SMART on FHIR Genomics,0,SMART on FHIR Genomics provides a framework for HER-based apps to built on FHIR that integrate clinical and genomics information.
Extension Domain,Extension to External References: GitHub,Extension to External References: GitHub,0,"Include an extension to GitHub repositories where HTS computational analysis pipelins, workflows, protocols, and tool or software source code can be stored, deposited, downloaded."
Description Domain,Description Domain,description_domain,0,"Structured field for description of external references, the pipeline steps, and the relationship of IO objects. Information in this domain is not used for computation. Capture information that is currently being provided in FDA submission in journal format."
Description Domain,Keywords,keywords,0,List of key map fields to hold a list of keywords to aid in search-ability and description of the object.
Description Domain,External References,xref,0,It contains a list of the databases and/or ontology IDs that are cross-referenced in the BCO. It provides more specificity in the information related to BCO entries.
Description Domain,Platform/Environment,platform,0,The multi-value reference to a particular deployment of an existing platform where this BCO can be reproduced (Galaxy or HIVE or CASAVA).
Description Domain,Pipeline tools,pipeline_steps,1,"For recording the specifics of a pipeline. Each individual tool is represented as step, at the discretion of the author. Step Number (step_number), Name (name), Tool Description (description), Tool Version (version), Tool Prerequisites (prerequisite), Input List (input_list), Output List (output_list)."
Execution Domain,Execution Domain,execution_domain,0,"The filelds required for execution of the BCO have been encapsulated together in order to clearly separate information needed for deployment, software configuration, and running applications in a dependent enviroment. "
Execution Domain,Script,script,0,"Points to an internal or external reference to a script object that was used to perform computations for this BCO instance. This may be reference to Galaxy Project or Seven Bridges Genomics pipeline, a Common Workflow Language (CWL) object in GitHub, HIVE computational service or any other type of script."
Execution Domain,Script Driver,script_driver,0,"The reference to an executable that can be launched in order to perform a sequence of commands described in the script. For example if the pipeline is driven by a HIVE script, the script driver is the hive  execution engine. For CWL based scripts specify cwl-runner. Another very general commonly used in Linux based operating systems is shell."
Execution Domain,Algorithmic tools and Software Prerequisites,software_prerequisites,1,"Field listing the minimal necessary prerequisites, library, tool versions needed to successfully run the script to produce BCO."
Execution Domain,External Data Endpoints,external_data_endpoints,0,An optional multi-value field listing the minimal necessary domain specific external data source access in order to successfully run the script to produce BCO.
