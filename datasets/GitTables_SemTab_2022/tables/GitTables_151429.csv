0.33,3.45, a period where the prophets prophesied
3.6,6.33, predicted the first coming of christ
6.51,32.34, and they all so predicted or prophecy about christ return over here in town escosura and many of the minor prophets so there are also speaking about this period of time all here in the in the future jesus at his first coming he also describes the period of matthew twenty four that we studied last week leventeen
32.34,52.77, the whole area is what he's explaining over here doing his allopathists also the top the apostles paul and john the revelator he gave them the book of revelation is describing the spirit of her in the future now as we saw last week some of these signs
53.25,56.67, been happening within the last few years
56.67,58.95, and is it like
59.19,62.67, what god is doing is that he's
62.73,66.18, getting this giant bull and a nisus
66.72,73.2, flinging this arrow by these prophets and all of the process all landing here in this time period
73.8,82.59, this is a not cared to predict the date not another bedside but it seems that all the ardath lord is
83.1,97.56, firing into this future is landing up in this time period jesus himself is all the arrows from his offices are all ending up in this same time period as well as paul and john the revelator
98.61,103.68, all of these prophecies are being fulfilled right in this time period
104.01,111.63, you unstinting now when we see all of the signs of this tribulation period
111.81,113.58, i fulfilled
114.66,120.93, start to be fulfilled what it does if it pushes the seven years of tribulation
120.93,122.52, closer
122.64,124.68, where we are
124.98,131.43, follow on so if we can see the signs of the tribulation period
132.84,141.3, how much closer is the rapture of the church because the rapture of the church will happen before the seven years of tribulation begins
141.45,144.99, so 
145.17,157.08, some of the signs that we can see that has covered is this sichtit with russia invaded israel with iron lydia sudan ethiopia and turkey now
157.35,184.44, what i kind of focus on is on the financial and technology part in nineteen eighty four i began working for the boy credit union league and i start to work with a lot of financial institutions the banks interviewing the banks here no bankers okay if if you're in an executive in the banks back in the edisons even to day they'll all tell you
184.47,213.09, they had been moving towards a catch ferocity they want to do away with cash because cash is problems there's so much problems with cash now i was in the safe with the other day and i went up to the express line you know and i wanted to express some because i just had maybe two or three items to buy and is supposed to be fast right and all of these people in front of me are pain with devices
213.45,224.91, and i'm the only one standing in line that katenka and i felt like that that dummy in that visceral have you seen it that he's holding up everything because he's the only one pay with cash
226.05,259.26, back in the s and s when we talked about this coming cash the society people still laughed at me i said no because we are moving from it a cash society were going at point electronic funds transfer and we're going to be using depictin the future people couldn't grasp the concept because white knows i explain last week ninety seven percent of walachians acted to day is digital cash only three per cent is actual cash being transacted the
260.1,265.32, what these authors have done is what they do is they connect the dots
265.71,297.12, because they can they can see the future because by just connecting the darcy draw logical conclusions about what the future will hold of a of a case society and the need for one because there's counterfeiting problems money laundering problems of problems of drugs and prostitution and all the crimes bank hold ups liquor store robberies cash is a major problem in our society they say you do away with cachimana ninety or ninety five percent of all crime
297.3,302.28, and this is where the anti christ will come into the scene and say i have the i have the answer
302.79,307.29, to this cashless form of transactions to
309.12,311.46, we there yet
311.82,315.57, and
315.99,322.08, wanted to show a few slides of where i think we are
324.69,333.03, a lot of places around the world are moving rapidly to this cashless system of the exchange
333.27,353.13, and japan with the haves what they call e cards and donovan chance the cash transactions with a cellphone you can point yourself one at a vending machine and eager transtevere food out of the vending machine
353.13,360.54, so eventually we are going to the complete cashless system now
361.29,365.4, in recently
365.46,368.49, we've been seen this problem of
368.79,385.44, immigration problem of a new identification with the illegal immigrants coming across from mexico and sin and fox news have been covering this illegal immigration problem and the need for a new identification card
385.47,410.58, back in the there was a sky a columnist named william satire who who did an editorial about this coming national id card back in the eighties and christians were up in arms about this new the national id card because william sat for had said in this article this tattoo will be pressed upon your forehead
410.64,416.73, and what that tattoo men was the baroda and
418.59,430.95, what i have here is a bark from anything off long stores or time to melsupper market or wherever
431.22,434.61, i mean even now that the paroisse six six six
434.67,443.34, now in every product in a supermarket where in long you have a barchette a product
443.64,464.1, numbers here the six numbers here represent the manufactures number and the six numbers on this side represents the product number but these numbers these barons in the middle on the outside and in the middle do not have any number representation those numbers are actual succes
464.88,471.81, these are what they call guard bars here in the outside in the middle and on the other side
472.59,516.39, you get onto the internet you type what wright zoulvisia a number of years said that when you typing to get onto the internet which you inactivity in six six six to get into the internet now this beast that was in belgium they were it was a huge master computer that wild identify every person on the world the beast that stood for belgium economic accounting surveillance terminal and this is a complete master computer that can identify every person in the world see during
516.66,520.5, time of the to 
520.92,536.4, be possible for christ to return during this time period of course not there there could be no world leader until to day because how would a world leader ruled the world in the year of the time of columbus
536.61,562.23, he would have to sail from europe that to asia would with howling with that ten years but see the time of the rule of antichrist will be only between three and a half to seven years depending on your interpretation but no more than seven years of his rule on planet earth so the world leader can only take place in this generation
562.29,569.85, we have satellite technology he could preach from washington d c he could preach from europe of
570.21,576.66, everyone worshipping him so the technology puts us right into this
577.47,578.76, period
579.21,589.02, so you can see that everything from here from the book of revelation is pushing us closer and closer to this time period of where we are in two thousand and eight
589.98,594.78, how close are we i don't know i mean i'm not here to predict the date
