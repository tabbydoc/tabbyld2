<h2>Title of Study: How do flashcards help learning?</h2>
<h1>PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SHEET </h1>

<h2>Invitation paragraph </h2>
You have been invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide whether to take part it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with friends and relatives if you wish to. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether you wish to take part or not. Thank you for reading this. 
 
 
<h2>What is the study about? </h2>
The study will investigate how flashcards influence your learning. 
 
 
<h2>What does the study involve? </h2>
You will be presented with 12 flashcards containing information from the perception and neuroscience module. You will be given 30 minutes to study the flashcards and after a 3 hour time gap, you will be able to take a 15 minute multiple choice test.
 
 
<h2>Do I have to take part? </h2>
It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be asked to sign a consent form. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time during the data collection without giving a reason. 
 
 
<h2>I am interested in taking part, what do I do next? </h2>
Please find a quiet room with minimal distractions. Please ensure you have a good internet connection on a PC / laptop / tablet device. You will be allotted 30 minutes time to study the flashcards. There will then be a gap of 3 hours before completing an online test. You will have 20 minutes to complete the test. Once ready please follow the link to the online study. 
 
 
<h2>What if I agree to take part and then change my mind? </h2>
That is fine. If you decide to withdraw after completing the task then you would need to provide your SONA ID to the researchers. The researcher will then delete all the data generated by that ID. 
 
 
<h2>Will my taking part in this study be kept confidential? </h2>
All information which is collected about you during the course of the research will be kept on a password protected database and is strictly confidential. You will be given an ID code which will be used instead of your name. The lead researcher will replace the SONA ID with a participant number to further anonymise the data before sharing it with the other researchers. 
 
 
<h2>Who has reviewed the study? </h2>
This study has been reviewed and approved by the school ethics committee and has been given a favourable ethical opinion for conduct. 
 
 
<h2>How is data secured? </h2>
No personally identifiable information will be stored for this project. <br>
