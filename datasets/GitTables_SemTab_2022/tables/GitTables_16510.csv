a575f37,2013-06-30T23:30:37,Reduced Basis change: Removed singe_matrix_mode. The purpose of this mode was to provide a low-memory version  which re-assembled matrices rather than storing them. But it wasn't used and therefore wasn't well tested  and it complicated the code for little benefit. If this functionality is desired in the future  better to put it in a subclass.,0.0
