`WRITE_DEBUG_HIV_DURATION_KM`,`DEBUG_HIVduration_KM*`,"Same as `WRITE_DEBUG_HIV_DURATION`, but writes output whenever an ART-naive HIV+ individual dies of AIDS-related illness, non-HIV causes, or starts ART for the first time. Output is also recorded at the end of the simulation for those HIV+ individuals who have not yet done any of those. The reason for recodring is also stored. Used for model validation of HIV duration.",0,
`WRITE_DEBUG_HIV_STATES`,`DEBUG_HIVstates_population*`,"Each year from start of HIV epidemic, (until `DEBUG_MAX_HIV_STATE_OUTPUT_TIME`, after which output is every 10 years to reduce file size), outputs key cascade variables for each HIV+ individual. Used to validate the ART cascade.",0,

`WRITE_CALIBRATION`,`Calibration_output_*`,"Succinct file for saving only the data essential for calibration (to reduce computation time).  Typically this is age and sex-stratified prevalence and HIV care cascade data at select time points when there is data to calibrate to (e.g. CHiPS, PC or DHS data).  File contains one row per simulation.  ",1,
