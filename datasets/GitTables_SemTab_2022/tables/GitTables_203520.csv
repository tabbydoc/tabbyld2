Clock Identity Authentication and Authorization,"Authentication refers to verifying the identity of the peer clock. Authorization, on the other hand, refers to verifying that the peer clock is permitted to play the role that it plays in the protocol.  For example, some nodes may be permitted to be masters,while other nodes are only permitted to be slaves or TCs. Authentication is typically implemented by means of a cryptographic signature, allowing the verification of the identity of the sender.  Authorization requires clocks to maintain a list of authorized clocks, or a ""black list"" of clocks that should be denied service or revoked.",Security

High Availability,"All components should be configured in a high availability configuration to eliminate single points of failure, and minimize solution outages.",Availability
Maintainability,"The system should allow for easy software upgrades with minimal outage. The outage should be restricted to no longer than one day, and allow for the use of a back up system for service continuity while the upgrade the taking place.",NFR
Maintainability,"Any solution must be maintainable by the affected maintenance team, both initially and throughout its lifecycle.
Unnecessary complexity in maintenance, such as by requiring additional / unusual skills or tools or having a complex solution design, adds risk to the solution’s supportability and must be justified.","maintainability, NFR"
Manageability,"All solutions must be managed throughout their lifecycle, including startup, shutdown, backup, updates, security / permission changes, etc. Administrators and support personnel must be able to conduct such routine activities effectively in order to ensure that the solution does not incur excessive cost or experience unnecessary outages.","manageability, NFR"

Privileged Accounts must not be used for non-administrator activities,"Privileged and super-user accounts (Administrator, root, etc.) must not be used for non-administrator activities.  A secure mechanism to escalate privileges (e.g., via User Account Control or via sudo) with a standard account is acceptable to meet this requirement. Network services must run under accounts assigned the minimum necessary privileges.",Security
