morph-csv,Morph-CSV,https://github.com/oeg-upm/morph-csv,10.5281/zenodo.3731941,Enhancing virtual KG access over tabular data with RML and CSVW,"Morph-CSV is an open source tool for querying tabular data sources using SPARQL. It exploits the information from the query, RML+FnO mappings and CSVW metadata to enhance the performance and completeness of traditional OBDA systems (SPARQL-to-SQL translators). At this moment can be embedded in the top of any R2RML-compliant system at it has been tested over different benchmarks such as BSBM, Madrid-GTFS-Bench but also over real-use cases such as querying the original data sources of the Bio2RDF project using different SPARQL-to-SQL engines such as Morph-RDB or Ontop.",https://morph.oeg.fi.upm.es/img/morph-csv.png,,
morph-rdb,Morph-RDB,https://github.com/oeg-upm/morph-rdb,,Morph-RDB is an RDB2RDF engine that translates SPARQL queries to SQL using R2RML mappings.,"Morph-RDB (formerly called ODEMapster) is an RDB2RDF engine developed by the Ontology Engineering Group, that follows the R2RML specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/).This engine supports two operational modes: data upgrade (generating RDF instances from data in a relational database) and query translation (SPARQL to SQL). Morph-RDB employs various optimisation techniques in order to generate efficient SQL queries, such as self-join elimination and subquery elimination. Morph-RDB has been tested with real queries from various Spanish/EU projects and has proven to work faster than other state-of-the-art tools available. At the moment, Morph-RDB works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2, CSV files and MonetDB.",https://morph.oeg.fi.upm.es/img/morph-rdb.png,,
morph-graphql,Morph-GraphQL,https://github.com/oeg-upm/morph-graphql,,Morph-GraphQL generates a GraphQL server from a R2RML mapping for providing access to an RDB.,"Morph-GraphQL exploits the information from declarative mappings rules (relation between target and source schema) and generates a GraphQL server. These mapping rules construct a virtual knowledge graph which is accessed by the generated GraphQL resolvers. These resolvers translate the input GraphQL queries into the queries supported by the underlying dataset. The use of declarative mappings is based on the idea that a standard mapping languagewould facilitate a better understanding of the relationships between the underlying data source and the exposed GraphQL schema. Furthermore, they also allow for better maintainability as those mappings are independent of any programming language.",https://morph.oeg.fi.upm.es/img/morph-graphql.png,,
mapeathor,Mapeathor,https://github.com/oeg-upm/Mapeathor,,Mapeathor is a simple spreadsheet parser that identifies the basic structures of the mappings and create a new file in a specific mapping language.,"Mapeathor is a tool able to generate mapping rules in three mapping languages: R2RML, RML (with extension to functions from FnO) and YARRRML. It takes the mapping rules expressed in a spreadsheet and transforms them into the desired language. The spreadsheet template is designed to facilitate the mapping rules' writting, with the aim of being language independent, and thus, lowering the barrier of generating mappings for non-expert users. Currently, Mapeathor is being used to generate mappings for open data publishing related to traffic, public bus transport and budget in the context of the Ciudades Abiertas project (http://www.ciudadesabiertas.es/).",https://morph.oeg.fi.upm.es/img/mapeathor.svg,,
morph-skyline,Morph-Skyline,https://github.com/oeg-upm/morph-skyline,,"Morph-Skyline is an RDB2RDF engine for skyline queries developed by the Ontology Engineering Group, that follows the R2RML specification","Morph-Skyline is an RDB2RDF engine for skyline queries developed by the Ontology Engineering Group, that follows the R2RML specification. It extends Morph-RDB and it supports two operational modes: data upgrade (generating RDF instances from data in a relational database) and skyline query translation (SPARQL to SQL). At the moment, Morph-Skyline works with EXASol as RDBMS.",https://morph.oeg.fi.upm.es/img/morph-skyline.png,,
