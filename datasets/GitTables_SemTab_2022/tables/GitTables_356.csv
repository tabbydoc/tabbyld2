For example, innovations derived by conventional plant breeding, transgenic plant breeding, and animal breeding. Also includes more upstream genetic work like identifying genes.  It’s important to distinguish between pre-breeding lines from ‘candidate’ varieties, where program participants co-develop with or provide to partners ‘candidate’ varieties that may be released by them.  The stages of reporting (detailed below) in this category include the successful production of a new or adapted variety that has, potentially, a substantial impact (whether through tolerance, efficiency, productivity or other) as evidenced in a paper due for publication (Stage 1); which are then tested more widely (Stage 2), if successfully tested then are ready for uptake - certification and licensing taken care of as necessary (Stage 3) and are then take up and used by the next user (Stage 4). Counting varieties and breeds will be by trait by agro-ecological zone.  That is to say each unique trait in a zone can be counted as one innovation.  The assumption being that the trait will be adapted sufficiently for each zone to be considered a separate innovation."
2,1,1900-01-01 00:00:00,2200-01-01 00:00:00,2.0,Production systems and Management practices,"""Production Systems research includes Integrated Pest Management (including grafting), Sustainable Intensification (e.g. mechanization, small-scale irrigation, planting schedules, soil management, etc.), Livestock Management, Post-Harvest technologies or management practices for feed or food, Natural Resource Management, Vaccines and Animal Health Services. The innovation should be assessed and counted in terms of whether the research firstly identifies potential practices and system components to generate new/improved system components or management practices with the potential to be superior to current farmer practices in field testing under end-user conditions (Stage 1), which are then tested more widely (Stage 2), if successfully tested then are ready for uptake - certification and licensing taken care of as necessary (Stage 3) and are then take up and used by the next user (Stage 4)."
3,1,1900-01-01 00:00:00,2200-01-01 00:00:00,3.0,Social Science,"""Social science includes research concerning the effectiveness of agricultural policy options (policy research); research on the socio-behavioral, socioeconomic, or sociopolitical factors that influence decision-making; research concerning economic forces affecting farmer choices, technology and management practice adoption, etc. (economic research); Research or creation of new/improved tools for market access, including financial and insurance products (market access); and nutrition research. Further examples of innovation in social science research may include evidence and recommendations that program participants provide to influence changes in policy and regulatory frameworks; or methods, decision-support tools and models to design/improve programs and projects or to develop value chains, land use planning approaches, etc; or even the development of a new curriculum or development of behavioral change models that ultimately influence the design of educational/extension programs.  The determination of a social science research innovation is around the uniqueness or value of the research finding(s) as evidenced in an article submitted for publication, working or conference paper (Stage 1). Replicating the research in other sites and/or testing it through examining causality and proxy / intermediate results through quasi-experimental or experimental (randomized trials) techniques (Stage 2). The availability of the research to next users in an accessible form represents Stage 3, while the 4th Stage is demonstrated uptake includes any support for, or adoption by, the public and/or private sectors at any point during the reporting period."
4,1,1900-01-01 00:00:00,2200-01-01 00:00:00,4.0,Biophysical Research,"Biophysical Research is an interdisciplinary science that applies the approaches and methods of physical sciences to study biological systems and may include computational biology, decision support tools, and geospatial analysis. The uptake and reporting pathway is similar to previous categories of research innovation; with findings from biophysical research that are considered potentially innovative outlined in a paper as the 1st Stage (excluding breeding and production systems research captured elsewhere); the wider testing of this research (Stage 2); availability for uptake (Stage 3) and actual proven uptake and application (Stage 4)."
5,1,1900-01-01 00:00:00,2200-01-01 00:00:00,5.0,Research and Communication Methodologies and Tools,"Research and Communication Methodologies and Tools includes new or improved research and communication tools including Information Communication Technology (ICT) such as seed catalogues and nutrient content databases that are used to disseminate scientific information and research findings to the public and private sectors. Communication tools include approaches and tools that have innovations embedded within them. For example, apps or platforms that can be applied in novel or different ways or generate new types of information. This does not include all deliverables (websites, databases, videos,  guides, etc.), but pertains to products which offer special and novel methods of information sharing, training, research methodologies, and/or communication of research. The stages of reporting are as per the previous examples, so don’t require further detailing here."
