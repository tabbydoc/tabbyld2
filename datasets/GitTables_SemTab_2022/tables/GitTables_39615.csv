Synthesizes 3OC6HSL, which binds to LuxR.

The lux cassette of V. fischeri contains a left and a right promoter. The right promoter gives weak constitutive expression of downstream genes.This expression is up-regulated by the action of the Lux repressor, LuxR. Two molecules of LuxR protein form a complex with two molecules the signalling compound HSL. This complex binds to a palindromic site on the promoter, increasing the rate of transcription.","http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_C0061
