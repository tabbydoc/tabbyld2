My boarding pass had the TSA Precheck printed on to it, but my wife's did not, so when we went through security as SFO, the officer wouldn't let my wife through the TSA Precheck line, even though I had the printout from Traveocity showing all the details, so it took three times as long for her to go through the security check as I did. Next, when we got to Seattle, our connecting flight to Cancun was cancelled, due to weather conditions at Cancun, so we had to stay overnight at a hotel. Alaska Airlines did not offer a hotel voucher, nor a meal voucher, as they had no control over the weather, but it seemed to me that it would have been good customer service to supply these things. They would have done it if it had been a mechanical isssue, but they found a loophole to not help us.","{'Seat comfort': 3.0, 'Customer service': 3.0, 'Cleanliness': 3.0, 'Food and Beverage': 1.0, 'Legroom': 3.0, 'In-flight Entertainment': 1.0, 'Value for money': 3.0, 'Check-in and boarding': 3.0}"

Check-in was simple on their app, flights all left on time, friendly service, and a clean plane. As we were de-boarding, staff was already coming onboard to start cleaning; I felt like they were taking it seriously. Also, they were GREAT about enforcing people wearing masks. They even called out a few times, ""mask over the nose please"" which I liked. I have flown over airlines during COVID and they were not nearly as on top of people keeping their masks on and on properly. I will try to fly with them again!","{'Seat comfort': 4.0, 'Customer service': 5.0, 'Cleanliness': 5.0, 'Food and Beverage': 4.0, 'Legroom': 4.0, 'In-flight Entertainment': 3.0, 'Value for money': 5.0, 'Check-in and boarding': 5.0}"

From the time I booked, I received very clear instructions and great service. Before boarding I was asked if I'd like to board first which was a huge relief because I didn't know how I was going to get around everyone. Then on the plane the flight attendants helped me with my luggage and constantly came by to make sure my dog Sammie was comfortable and had water. Everyone was so friendly and nice the entire process. I was sad I couldn't fly Alaskan home!",{}
