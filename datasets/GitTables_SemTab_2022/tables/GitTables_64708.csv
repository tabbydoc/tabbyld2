1,Avastin,Non-compliant,1,,Bevacizumab,"1.25mg in 0.05ml every 6 weeks for 3 doses, and then when required",Intravitreal injection through the pars plana,596,Injection,6,weeks,The patient will be followed up every 4-6 weeks and repeat injections will be given in the presence of evidence of persisting activity in the choroidal neovascular membrane. Most non AMD cases need 3 injections or less.,"There have, till date, been no large prospective randomised controlled studies that have looked at the safety of intravitreal injections of Bevacizumab.
Two large retrospective studies have been reported.
The first is a single centre study done at the Department of Ophthalmology, Medical School of Athens University, Athens, Greece. Four hundred and fifty patients receiving 2,000 injections (1,275 bevacizumab and 725 ranibizumab) were followed up from 3 to 24 months and the following adverse effects were noted.
retinal detachment 0.5%
uveitis 1.90%, which was treated successfully and lasted not more than 12 days.
subconjuctival hemorrhage 10% (Patients receiving aspirin treatment were more prone to have subconjuctival hemorrhage P = 0.0002).
There was no statistically significant difference between the patients treated with bevacizumab or ranibizumab regarding the noted adverse events.
REF: Safety of repeat intravitreal injections of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab: our experience after 2,000 injections. Ladas et al, Retina. 2009 Mar;29(3):313-8.
The second study is a retrospective, multicenter, open label, uncontrolled interventional case series of 1,173 patients who were injected with bevacizumab for diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusions, and CNV of several etiologies including ARMD and were followed up for 12 months. A total of 4,303 intravitreal injections of bevacizumab were performed. 
Adverse Effects noted:
Systemic adverse events were reported in 1.5% patients; these included 
acute elevation of systemic blood pressure 0.59%
cerebrovascular accidents 0.5%
myocardial infarctions 0.4%
iliac artery aneurysms 0.17%
toe amputations 0.17%
deaths 0.4%
Ocular complications:
bacterial Endophthalmitis 0.16%
tractional retinal detachments 0.16%
Uveitis 0.09%
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment 0.02%
vitreous hemorrhage 0.02%
The study concluded Repeated intravitreal injections of bevacizumab appear to be safe and well tolerated during the 1st year.

4,PDT,PDT,1,,Photodynamic therapy,TAP dose PDT with verteporfin every 3 months when required.,Intravenous infusion of Vertoprofin followed by exposure of the retina ro diode laser,2407,Injection,3,months,The patient will be followed up every three months and repeat treatments will be given in the presence of evidence of persisting activity. Most patients resolve with 3 treatment cycles or less.,"The following side effects were noted with an increased incidence when compared with placebo in the TAP and VIP trials. 
Systemic: mostly mild and transient.
1. injection site reactions
2. photosensitivity
3. infusion related back 
Ocular:
1. Visual disturbances
2. Acute severe visual acuity decrease  - 0.7-4.9%
These trials as we know evaluated the efficacy and safety of Verteporfin PDT in AMD and not CSCR/ choroidal haemangioma.
The prospective studies of PDT in CSCR to date have not reported any systemic or ocular adverse effects.

The respond would be assessed at 6 months to determine whether a second injection is required,"Ocular adverse events that reached significance was and increase in pain (7.4 % vs 3.8%), ocular hypertension ( 4% vs 0.7%) and anterior chamber inflammation (1/2% vs 0%) in the implant group vs sham group respectively.

There was no increase in non-ocular side effects in the treatment group vs the sham group."
