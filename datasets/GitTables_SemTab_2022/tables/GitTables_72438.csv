Highly recommended,"I have bought the 128GB Product RED version. Being an Android user, it was a different hands-on experience of the XR and Iam really liking it.Display looks great, sound quality is great, camera quality is good and mainly the gaming performance is so smooth and fast and never felt a single frame drop ever.Even though its costly for an ""Budget"" apple iphone, it's worth the money I have spent on this mobile.READ MORE",Vignesh Jayabal,5

Fabulous Product. Love It.!,"The phone has a supreme build and a sturdy feel in hands. Coming from a 6S, I felt it was a bit too wide, but It‚Äôll grow on you. The RED is by far the best color among available. And this one is an absolute battery champ and won‚Äôt let you down. Charging is also pretty fast if you use a fast charger. I use an iPad 12W charger to top it up and it goes from 10% to 90% within 90 mins. If we take in the factor of longevity of the iPhones (iOS support and updates for atleast next 5 years), this is ...READ MORE",Akash Singh,5
Very Good,"After using android for 10 yrs m, i moved to iOS and i must say its very difficult to find n use iPhone...i will come to this later , let me start with features: nice camera but not better than samsung note 8.. display bright n good .. nice sound and very good look... a bit bulky... What irritates me :1. Setting ur fav song as ringtone: torture to do that...2. 90% of good app either wallpaper or ringtones or utility: are paid..3 iCloud only 5gb..4. Not able to migrate chrome bookmarks ...READ MORE",Samit Katiyar,4
Wonderful,"Let‚Äôs keep it simple,Phone is damn smooth and if you are coming from Android, you will really notice the difference no matter which smartphone you used earlier.Pros:1. Camera and image processing (portrait modes)2. Battery (7hrs screen on time) i.e. all day battery life3. iOS (If you are coming from Android, you will need 2 days to get used to it.. like gestures and all but once you are into it, there's no way turning back. Animations are refined and you will enjoy them)4. Face ID is su...READ MORE",Ashish Bahure,4
Wonderful,"Awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è. Just go for it. I am very happy with my decision for buying XR instead of iPhone 8 Plus, X, XS and XS Max. Here are the comparisons among these models which made it easy for me to decide to buy this iPhoneScreen:1. This iPhone has HD screen but others have full HD. Still it doesn‚Äôt disappoint me while watching full HD video.2. Perfect screen size, Not too big(8 Plus, XS Max) and Not very small(iPhone X or iPhone XS). Design:1. All these models (except 8 plus) have new iPhon...READ MORE",Flipkart Customer,5
Great product,"I feel as if the people who gave the iPhone XR low ratings either didn't know what they were getting or didn't do research. I did a lot of research about the XR by watching a lot of Youtube videos of what the XR had to offer and the changes made from the previous iPhone models. The first thing is that the XR doesn't have a Finger Print Home Button, instead it uses Face Recognition to unlock it or a Pin Code. Second thing is that the Control Center has moved from swiping up from the bottom to ...READ MORE",AAKASH  SIMSON,5
Brilliant,"Shifted from iPhone SE to XR .....a sea change .  The Camera both front and rear are amazing with fantastic editing options . The Face ID makes unlocking phone apps etc so smooth , the size is also just right ...anything bigger than this should be called tab . The screen resolution is good . I am enjoying my iPhone XR,READ MORE",Shailendra Singh Rawat,5
Terrific,"Frankly speaking I was hesitating to place order online for such huge amount phone but the exchange facility, committed delivery time and the packaging is absolutely fine. Thanks to  Flipkart. Talking about the phone - I switched to iOS for the first time. I am One plus lover but I didn‚Äôt want to pay to Chinese product hence got this amazing made in California and assembled in India product. Smooth touch, ease of handling and good battery life is giving nice experience. Value for money!READ MORE",Vivek  Soman,5
