Envisioning the future data industry as a global, cooperative and decentralized ecosystem, the Dopamine network is the pipeline for rewarding the various players in such an economy, gradually introducing a new type of data processing economy.   A New Data Computing Economy Currently, most data and IP is owned by deep pocket firms, leaving smaller enterprises with highly expensive end to end services, as a result independent developers or small IP related firms struggle to keep and monetize their IP. The rise of blockchain technology has created an opportunity to develop a network of rewards and interactions. In this network, there are far more data and service providers, each with unique expertise, and each provider is rewarded granularly according to its data or service demand.    Dopamine and AI  The Dopamine ecosystem fits perfectly within the emergence of AI solutions: Data: Data is a valuable product for training AI systems. The Dopamine ecosystems rewards different data providers for training the same system. Transfer learning: AI systems that have been trained on a certain task can be reused for another task. When one group reuses another entity’s AI system, the Dopamine ecosystem rewards this collaboration, all without revealing the original entity’s IP. Deep systems: The Dopamine system enables different AI-based entities to collaborate and find novel solutions to complex challenges. As a result, contributing entities reap rewards - and still, retain their IP. Conditional Rewarding: The Dopamine ecosystem rewards data providers and processors based on their tool's success in solving specific problems. Incentivizing different entities for reaching shared goals.  How it works As more and more data & data processing providers offer their services on the Dopamine network in return for predefined rewards, the Dopamine network enables the data consumer to create a data processing pipeline to solve new challenges: No need to pay a giant firm to solve your AI issues No fees Maximum collaboration Maximum competition Never sacrifice your AI IP  DOPA : The Dopamine Token The Dopamine Token, to be created during the crowd-funding phase, will be the only supported crypto-currency reward flowing in the Dopamine network. The Dopamine Token will act as a reward for groundbreaking collaboration and problem-solving.  Our Team Uri Yerushalmi, PhD. Managing founder Xiuyuan Zheng, PhD, PhD. Algo Architect Tal Heletz.
