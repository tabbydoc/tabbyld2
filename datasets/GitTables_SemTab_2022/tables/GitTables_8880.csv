I'm pretty sure that the `application/x-unknown` is the one that would work for you since this is what Firefox itself determines as your file's mime-type.

You may also do the following:

 * download this specific file manually with Firefox
 * when the Save File popup would be opened, check the ""do this automatically for files like this from now on"" checkbox and save the file
 * now, go to Help -> Troubleshooting Information
 * find the profile directory and save the path to it
 * in your Selenium code, start Firefox with the `FirefoxProfile` pointing to this existing profile, see more about how to do it [here][1]
