ALTper10k,"ALT per 10,000 population","Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a Liver Function Test (LFT) commonly requested by GPs. It is often requested without a clear purpose. For example, many practices request LFTs in chronic disease management to monitor the effects of statins. NICE guidance does not recommend this more than 12 months after starting the statin if results are not abnormal.  (Homer et al. 2017).   It may be useful for practices to know if they are testing at a higher or lower rate than average."
CRPperCRP-ESR,CRP tests as a proportion of CRP and ESR tests,"C-Reative Protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) are common non-specific inflammatory markers in primary care. Evidence for their use is poor, but CRP has marginally superior diagnostic accuracy for infections (Watson et al, 2019). ESR are also more expensive and more time consuming for laboratories."
CRPperCRP-ESR-PV,"CRP tests as a proportion of CRP, ESR and PV tests","C-Reative Protein (CRP), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and Plasma Viscosity (PV) are all requested as common, non-specific inflammatory markers in primary care. Evidence for their use is poor, but CRP has marginally superior diagnostic accuracy for infections (Watson et al, 2019). ESR are also more expensive and more time consuming for laboratories."
HBper10k,"Haemoglobin tests per 10,000 population","Haemoglobin (Hb) is a measure of red blood cells commonly requested by GPs, often as part of a Full Blood Count. These tests are often requested without a clear purpose. For example, many practices request Hb in chronic disease management when it is not clinically indicated. In such cases, they can be safely reduced (Whiting et al. 2019).  It may be useful for practices to know if they are testing at a higher or lower rate than average."

Kper10k,"Potassium tests per 10,000 population",Potassium is commonly monitored as a renal function test. It may be useful for practices to know if they are testing at a higher or lower rate than average.
Kproportionabove,Potassium tests - proportion above reference range,"Potassium is commonly monitored as a renal function test. Hyperkalaemia is a serious medical condition which, if severe, requires urgent hospitalisation. However, test potassium levels can be significantly affected by in vitro effects, such as storage time and temperature, and whether the sample has been centrifuged before transport. This can affect the result, and the corresponding treatment of the patient. Seasonal peaks in this measure may indicate high rates of false positives."

TSHper10k,"TSH tests per 10,000",Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is a test commonly performed in primary care. It is used often to diagnose an under or overactive thyroid. It is also used as a test in Tired All The Time (TATT). The 2013 Atlas of Variation found a 57-fold variation between GP practices in the level of testing. They can have a very low proportion of abnormal results and could be safely reduced (Werhun and Hamilton 2015). It may be useful for practices to know if they are testing at a higher or lower rate than average.

VDper10k,"Vitamin D tests per 10,000 population","Vitamin D testing rates have increased dramatically, according to a study in CPRD since around 2005 (O'Sullivan et al), but testing is not a prerequesite to advise patients to take supplements if a deficiency is suspected. It may be useful for practices to know if they are testing at a higher or lower rate than average."
