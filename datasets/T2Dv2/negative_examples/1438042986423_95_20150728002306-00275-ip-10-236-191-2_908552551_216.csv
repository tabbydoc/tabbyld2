What to do for fun,"Lots of sporting events to attend, if that's your thing! Dawgs After Dark is especially fun and they do it a few times each semester. $1 movies at the student center every weekend lots of free things to do, like play with the puppies at the animal shelter or visit the botanical gardens on campus!"
Food and Dining,The meal plan is top-notch and is all-you-can-eat! (Just don't eat too much... it makes the freshman 15 all too easy!) There's also plenty of awesome places to eat around campus and in Downtown Athens.
Dorm Life,"The residence advisors are awesome - extremely friendly and very helpful! You will meet some of your best friends in your dorm if you are open minded and step out of your comfort zone a little bit. Community bathrooms are not that bad, I promise!"
Academic Rigor,"Doing the work and doing it well is key. If you study hard and use all the resources you can, you will succeed! Don't be afraid to get help in as many places as possible!"
Tips for prospective students,"Be open minded - take a class you might not be all that interested in, and be open to advice from others! Think about the big picture when choosing a major - what exactly do you plan on doing with your degree? Time management is KEY!"
In three sentences,There is never a dull moment at UGA! There is always something fun going on no matter what it is you're interested in. It's a very diverse student body with opportunities for everyone.
