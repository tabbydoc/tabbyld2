Campus Safety,Public Safety communicates with the entire campus via email to alert us of new procedures and precautions to take. I feel very well looked after.
Clubs and Activities,"From social issues to academic to creative issues, there's a club for everyone!"
Great for these types of students,"All types. Fresh out of high school, older students already in the depths of their careers, international students, etc."
Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus,"There's music everywhere! There's quiet spaces in the library to do work, but the environment on this campus is unlike any other. The halls are overflowing with talent."
Bang for the buck,"Berklee is pricey, because you're paying for some of the best of the best. Another reason to work extra hard! Berklee offers tuition payment plans which are a great option for some!"
What to do for fun,"Sooooooo many great concerts in the metro area, and Berklee students get discounts tickets to some of them! Berklee students also have FREE access to the Fine Arts Museum, which is lovely. When the weather is nice, there are beautiful bike trails and parks for recreational fun. And the beach is only 45 minutes away. There are almost endless options for dancing and nightlife to suit your tastes!"
Food and Dining,On campus cafeteria (where there are often late night performances and concerts by fellow students. Dining doesn't get much better than that!) There are tons of nearby and affordable places to grab food between classes!
Academic Rigor,"Be ready to work hard towards your goals. These teachers take you seriously as a musician. Do yourself a favor and take yourself seriously, as well. Learning here is fun!"
Tips for prospective students,"Be sure to prep well for your audition and interview! Remember that Berklee looks for your potential, and knows everyone is coming to the school with a different skill set. They have your best academic interests at heart. Have fun and stay open!"
In three sentences,"Berklee has incredibly thorough teachers. There are countless opportunities for learning and growth outside the classroom including workshops and physical fitness programs. Berklee is incredibly welcoming to all students, regardless of age, experience, and place of origin."
