I have been researching Gladiolus dalenii for suitability to be grown on green roofs and have found them to be very suitable giving a blaze of colour on rooftops that are not too subjected to high wilds that can blow the flower spikes over. I have more information at the following web addresses for those who would like to know more about this very attractive plant for use on green roof applications. http://www.ecoman.co.za/green/green_docs/gladiolus_dalenii.h... ... read morer />"

I have it under Viburnum plicatum tomentosum, which drops its leaves just in time to show this Gladi growing up through the horizontal branches (which hold it up and stop it flopping), and it grows so tall the flower heads reach above the top branches, though eventually I may have to relocate them if shrub gets taller. It's taller than I am! It multiplies slowly and doesn't show invasive tendencies here (zone 8a)."

They bloomed very well the first year, survived the winter with mulching, and as of May 1 are pushing up new growth. It was a mild winter with heavy snowfall. The lowest temperature was 2 degrees above zero F. Corms were planted both along building foundations and in the open garden. I am curious to see how they do over a colder winter, but have read that Gladiolus dalenii is Zone 6 hardy."

I dug it up, moved it to my garden and it is doing beautiful! It is absolutely gorgeous. I will be looking for more! The flowers also seem to last longer than most glads - nearly 3 weeks!"

I found a web entry that said it was 'rare' and they were charging $20 per plant...I found other websites that said it was noxious and considered a weed because it can become invasive. However, I didn't see it as being any more invasive than any other gladiolus. I love the bright orange and yellow bicolor flowers with the yellow speckles in the orange. The blooms are smaller than the commerical glads, but the color is so showy, that it just jumps out at you when you see it by the road. and it is very hardy in the SE Alabama/ SWGeorgia heat."
