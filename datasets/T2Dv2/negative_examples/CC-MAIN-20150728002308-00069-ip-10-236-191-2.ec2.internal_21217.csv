NintyMan,"3,001. Posted: Tue 5th Nov 2013 01:58 GMT Now let's move on to Kirby characters. I believe King Dedede will return, and his new final smash without a doubt should be Masked Dedede. He would be twice as powerful in this state, like Wario was twice as powerful as Wario-Man. @zoroarkrules25: What's the source of those rumors? Edited on Tue 5th November, 2013 @ 02:03 by NintyMan"

Your thoughts? lol, just kidding, dude. But seriously, please don't do that again."

I will giggle like a little schoolgirl if Ike gets cut. Especially if he gets replaced with Chrom, or some magic user. >:3 I'd just be giddy if, on the next Nintendo Direct, Mr. Iwata said ""Because of the popularity of 'Fire Emblem: Awakening', we have decided to replace [Ike or Marth.] with Lucina."" Why? Because then the Internet would explode and devolve into the sexist wasteland I know it is. And when all is said and done and the streets are on fire, I'll be there to say ""I knew it! Even though I've seen the Internet act this way several times before, and it really didn't need reinstatement, I knew the Internet was this bad!"" And then I will laugh. I'd prefer Micaiah to Lucina, because she would literally be the same as Marth. Micaiah at the least is a magic user, and she had more personality than Lucina. u_u Costumes maybe. And they will probably not add Lucina, since the game came out in only 2012 in Japan, and spoilers. What about Robin (aka My Unit) from Awakening? Think about it, he could have options to use either a sword or a magic tome, plus have a gender swap like Wii Fit Trainer. Kill two birds with one stone. u_u However that would just add to the growing list of customizable characters... I saw this one youtube comment on a video for the game's soundtrack (it has almost been a year and the music still hasnt gotten old for me) and the user suggested that Smash Bros 4 should take the avatar you have saved on file and put that specific My unit and put it in the game. Its a really interesting idea but I doubt it will see the light of day."

Looks like it'll be easy enough to zone the tree, lol. Hope this doesn't promote camping either...looks like it can be used as an obstacle to hide behind. x.x So maybe that's a plus to it's viability, lol.

Maybe the special (whichever one it is) consists of three parts with the last part being the pay off attack."

mamp,"3,013. Posted: Tue 5th Nov 2013 16:43 GMT I wonder what the AC villager's final smash will be? I wonder if it can top my idea (leaf storm, a bunch of leaves fall from the sky and then ""POOF"" they transform into giant furniture and rain down on everyone)."

We haven't seen Villager use a grounded, neutral A move, maybe THAT is the slingshot. Might be right about the projectile grab too. It's actually quite confusing to think which move goes where...because Villagers moveset is pretty odd. Edited on Tue 5th November, 2013 @ 18:09 by Orngeblu"
