Most of the symptoms i can deal with, like the sweaty hands, headaches, you all know what i am talking about. But the one thing that really gets me is the feeling of going crazy. For me, crazy is hurting the people around me. I so afraid of that. I just can't help welling on that. If i could just figure out how to get rid of that, i am so sure that i would get better, or life would be easier."
