We used Herbert Byaruhanga of Uganda Bird Safaris as our ground agent and would not hesitate to recommend him to others, we had a great time. Herbert can be contacted on byaruhanga@hotmail.com. Our itinerary was designed in consultation with Herbert and worked reasonably well - possible improvements are discussed below. Herbert accompanied us throughout the trip and is a useful guy in the field and knows all the major sites and a number of great little stop-offs en route to places. Herbert was flexible during the trip and happy to make changes to the itinerary. Make sure you get Herbert to lead your trip if you use his services! Herbert has a network of local guides that he uses wherever possible and on the whole these guys are very good and definitely added value to our trip. We only had reservations about the guide at Bwindi who failed to measure up to the high standards set by the majority. Herbert charged us an all-inclusive $2780 per person (including gorilla permits) which as it was timed with a fall in the value of the US dollar worked out reasonably well., 4664\u003dUganda 14th July-5th Aug 2004, Author, 1243\u003dWe could not heed Sam Woods\u0027 excellent advice re timing of trips due to other commitments but can only reinforce what he says on the subject. July/August is great for seeing grassland species (eg bishops and widows) in full plumage, and the weather is benign, but it is a very hard time to be birding generally, especially during dry spells. We had little response to tapes and found things very difficult, especially at Bwindi. Consider going in April/May (during short wet season) or September (just at start of big wet) for better birding (although the roads may be tricky at this time - best to check with Herbert). African green broadbill nests are usually located in April/May and staked out at Mubwindi.}","TableContextTimeStampAfterTable":"{8920\u003dMy thanks go to primarily to Herbert and the members of his excellent guide network who did their utmost to get us onto as many birds as possible. The dips were sadly mostly our fault! I also thank the rest of the crew - it would have been a very different trip without you guys - so thanks go to Gordon Allison, Nigel and Carol Mears and Graeme and Moira Wallace. Thanks also too to Pete, Alan, Ashley and Neil for gen and advice at Budongo and Murchison.
