1 is a block diagram of a CPU 10 incorporating the present invention. The CPU, sometimes referred to as the F86, is designed to execute an instruction set (macro-instructions) compatible with that of the Intel 80386, as described in the Intel 80386 Programmer \u0027s Reference Manual published by Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, Calif., 1986. Each block in the diagram corresponds generally to a separate integrated circuit chip or group of chips in a current embodiment. The CPU communicates with external devices such as memory controllers, I/O devices, and possibly other CPU\u0027s via a system bus 11. References below to functional units will normally be understood to mean elements within CPU 10, not such external devices., 113179\u003dThe following describes the terminations set out in Table 6. Note that, for all the abnormal terminals indicating exceptions on p-ops, bits \u003c3.0≦ of the Termination Id directly corresponds to the interrupt number of the exception for which processing should be initiated. The two exceptions to this are the alternate Debug and General Protection fault codes (i.e., 1111 010�) used for special cases. The Shutdown abnormal termination (code\u003d1111 1001) is also special in that exception processing will not occur, instead DEC will shutdown., 118535\u003dIt should be noted that some of these abnormal terminations relate to specific macroinstructions. In particular the 387 Not Available, Invalid Opcode, and General Protection (code\u003d1111 0100 terminations are signaled on the 1st p-ops of relevant p-op sequences. Further, some of these abnormal terminations, while not relating to specific macro-instructions, do relate to macro-instruction instruction boundaries. The General Protection termination (code\u003d1111 0100 and the Debug termination (code\u003d1111 0101, for debug faults) are signaled on the 1st p-ops of macro-instruction p-op sequences. The Debug termination (code\u003d1111 0001, for debug traps) is signaled on the last p-op of macro-instruction and task switch p-op sequences., 143602\u003dLike other units of the CPU, the MCC must track the tag status provided to it by DEC via the tag status bus. Each clock cycle, DEC transmits one of two message types on the tag status bus, either an advisory of the oldest outstanding p-op tag (OOTag) or an abort tag (ATag). The WRESQ maintains a pointer to its oldest entry called the Oldest Entry Pointer (OEP). An entry remains ineligible to be written to memory until it is becomes older than the OOTag. Each cycle in which an OOTag is received, the OOTag is compared to the tag CAM contents of each write queue entry having one or more Valid bits set that does not already have its Released bit set. Tag comparison is performed by subtracting the four-bit OOTag from the entry\u0027s four-bit Tag using four-bit two\u0027s-complement arithmetic. Tags are issued in binary counting sequence (0000, 0001, 0010, . . . 1110, 1111, 0000, . . . ) and no more than seven tags are outstanding at any time, so that the value of OOTag can jump by at most eight from one cycle to the next (if all seven outstanding p-ops are retired and a new p-op is issued in the same cycle). Therefore, if the value of the most significant bit of the difference formed by subtracting OOTag from an entry\u0027s tag is \"1\" it indicates that the entry\u0027s tag is between one and eight p-ops older than the OOTag, since it cannot be eight or more younger than the OOTag. For each entry that is thus found to be younger than the OOTag, the entry\u0027s Released bit is set. The entry can be written to cache and/or maintain memory when and only when the entry pointed to by the OEP has its Released bit set, its Present bit set, and one or more Valid bits set. When the write occurs, the entry\u0027s Valid bits are cleared and the OEP is advanced to the next sequential entry that has one or more Valid bits set, if any exist., 26167\u003dThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser.
