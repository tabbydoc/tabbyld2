Horowitz Publication Number: SP4 Year: 1995 Pages: 58, 13698\u003dIn the short term, hydrology responds to the topography, soils and vegetation of the landscape, but over longer time spans the entire landscape is moulded by the flow of water. The process scale ranges from the splash erosion by individual raindrops to the accumulation of sediment as alluvial fans, to the evolution of drainage networks. Kirkby presents a systematic analysis of the relationships between hydrology and geomorphology with commentaries on the papers which have been most influential in the development of research at the hydrology/geomorphology interface. Thirty-seven papers are reprinted in full or in part, the majority published pre-1970, including early contributions by Fisher (1866), Davison (1889) and Gilbert (1909), and seminal papers by Hack, Strahler, Wolman \u0026 Miller, and Melton, among others.

A large part of his scientific work was dedicated to understanding the movement, circulation and physical characteristics of water in its different forms. This book aims to make Leonardo Da Vinci\u0027s contributions to the science of water accessible to a wider public and to compare his ideas with our present knowledge. Fascinating, revealing and inspiring, Leonardo Da Vinci\u0027s Water Theory opens up a new history to the study of water. Two hundred years before Newton, Perrault and Halley, Leonardo Da Vinci was doing hypothesis-driven science and describing and classifying hydrological processes. For example, he came close to the modern definition of the hydrological cycle, recognising that water passes through the major river systems countless times, summing up to volumes much greater than those contained in the world\u0027s oceans., 140061\u003dAuthor / Editor: T.M.

Four keynote papers open this volume, and the remaining 50 contributions are grouped by theme: â€¢ Dynamic processes of erosion and sediment transport in fluvial systems â€¢ Impacts of climate change and human activities on erosion and sediment yield â€¢ Modelling erosion and sediment yields â€¢ Mountain hazards and debris flows â€¢ Monitoring and tracing methodology, 43017\u003dThe contributions selected for this volume from ICCE2014 present the latest progress on research covering topics from hillslope and channel erosion to riverine sediment transport, sediment-associated contamination and pollution, catchment and river basin sediment yield, integrated erosion-sediment modelling, and sediment dynamics in coastal systems. The New Orleans symposium on Sediment Dynamics from the Summit to the Sea continued the successful, ongoing series of International Commission on Continental Erosion (ICCE) of IAHS symposia but was unique in being held on a large river delta; and highlighting the beneficial sides of erosion and sedimentation in connection with coastal and delta building processes., 77678\u003dThe contributions arise from the 2014 Kovacs Colloquium held at UNESCO in Paris, which addressed the emergence and development of water security concepts.

The Nile is shown to be a set of very different tributaries which came together by geological accident. Nevertheless, evidence from one part of the basin often throws light on a different area. Recent changes are discussed, in particular the dramatic change of regime of Lake Victoria and other lakes which occurred after 1961. The relationship between hydrology and vegetation affects the important wetlands of the White Nile basin, and discussion of this relationship includes the effect of increased lake outflows. The authors draw on the extensive records collected throughout the basin to paint a detailed hydrological picture of the regime of the Nile. The book is illustrated by over 100 diagrams and photographs, and its scope is indicated by the list of contents overleaf. J. V. Sutcliffe has worked on all the major Nile tributaries over a period of 50 years and has been the author of many papers and reports on the different hydrological problems. Y. P. Parks has worked on hydrological models of the Sudd and on water resources problems of several Nile tributaries, 199675\u003dAuthor / Editor: Berit Arheimer et al.

With the aid of the Introduction and Commentaries, they provide a stimulating insight to developments in this part of the field of hydrology.   , 359417\u003dQuestions of global and climate change, use of energy resources and waste deposition, mean that work with groundwater now needs to include the interfaces to the atmosphere, surface waters and deeper formations that are potentially used for geothermal energy and CO2 storage, and ModelCARE2011 reflected that. More than ever, models are means to integrate information from different and manifold sources, allowing a better conceptual view of systems as a whole and improving understanding of them, i.e. models are repositories of knowledge. This volume considers: Parameter estimation, Uncertainty, Numerical and computational methods, Reactive transport and bioremediation, Stochastic and multi-scale models, Couple processes in the subsurface, and Groundwater flow and climate., 20551\u003dStudy specifically of riparian zones is relatively new in hydrology, and while the oldest benchmark paper selected for this volume dates to 1936, several of the others were published in the 1970s and 1980s. Burt, Pinay and Sabater introduce them with a review of the role of the riparian zone. Its services as a buffer for nitrates and other agricultural and industrial pollutants has focused the attention of ecologists and hydrologists. It is an ecological boundary between terrestrial and aquatic environments, but also a distinct ecotone because of the intimate connection between the two. The 36 benchmark papers are grouped under the topics Landscape Ecology, Hydrology of the Riparian Zone, Linking Riparian Zone Hydrology to Solute Transport, Biogeochemical Processes and Methods, Riparian Buffering of Surface and Subsurface Flows, and In-stream Processes.

Baker is Regents Professor in Hydrology and Water Resources at the University of Arizona, USA, and holds joint chairs in the departments of Geosciences and Planetary Sciences there. His research interests broadly concern palaeohydrology and related aspects of geomorphology, with a particular focus on flood processes. He also works in the area of planetary geomorphology and on issues that involve Earth science in relation to public policy, the environment and philosophy of science. An excellent resource for graduate and post-graduate level courses in hydrology and hydro-geomorphology, reproducing many important papers that are otherwise difficult to access. Palaeolakes were found to afford information central to understanding past climate in the 1960s and three seminal papers are included. Palaeobotanical evidence to aid palaeohydrological work originated in the 1960s, and Sigafoos (1964) is a significant contribution. Palaeoflood Hydrology brings together the papers that mark the development from geological investigation of flood-scarred landscapes to a broader, global science rooted in environmental change studies. Megafloods are high-discharge (\u003e106 m3/s) flood flows now known to have been especially important at the end of the Pleistocene, but in 1923, Bretz’s hypothesis of such “cataclysmic flows” was controversial. Sediment Transport shows how engineering/geomorphologic under¬standing of sediment processes was initially used to back-calculate the flows associated with fluvial events.
