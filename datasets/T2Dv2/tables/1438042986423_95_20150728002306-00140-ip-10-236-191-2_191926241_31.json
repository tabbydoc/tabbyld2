However, in 1970 when the scientists Howard Temin and David Baltimore both independently discovered the enzyme responsible for reverse transcription, named reverse transcriptase, the possibility that genetic information could be passed on in this manner was finally accepted.[6], 21309\u003dReverse transcriptases were discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison in RSV virions,[4] and independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses: R-MLV and again RSV.[5] For their achievements, both shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco)., 35110\u003dInitial reports of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes came as far back as 1971 (Beljanski et al., 1971a, 1972). These have since been broadly described as part of bacterial Retron msr RNAs, distinct sequences which code for reverse transcriptase, and are used in the synthesis of msDNA. In order to initiate synthesis of DNA, a primer is needed. In bacteria, the primer is synthesized during replication.[12]}","lastModified":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 17:18:59 GMT","textBeforeTable":"Model details: search method: hmmsearch -Z 80369284 -E 1000 --cpu 4 HMM pfamseq build method: hmmbuild -o /dev/null HMM SEED HMM build commands: HMM information 39.48 % Average coverage of the sequence by the domain: 62 % Average identity of full alignment: 165.80 aa Average length of the domain: 244283 Number in full: 69 Number in seed: Eddy SR Author: Family Type: rvt; RVT; Previous IDs: Published_alignment and HMM_iterative_training Seed source: Curation This section shows the detailed information about the Pfam family.
