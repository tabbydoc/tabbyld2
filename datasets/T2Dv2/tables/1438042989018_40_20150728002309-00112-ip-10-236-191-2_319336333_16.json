How many teams, in the span of 4 years, have seen statistical failures as big as the 2007 and 2010 Padres? (Jed Hoyer from San Diego) Gene Mauch to one side, I don\u0027t think managers deserve all the blame for late-season collapses. The Padres skid was definitely terrible, and losing 10 games straight is a good way to blow it. But the players played--and lost--those games.
