In the illustrative embodiment, the image sensing array 22 has, for example, a 1280�1024 pixel resolution (�″ format), 6 micron pixel size, with randomly accessible region of interest (ROI) window capabilities. It is understood, though, that many others kinds of imaging sensing devices (e.g. CCD) can be used to practice the principles of the present invention disclosed herein, without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention., 142235\u003dFIG. 3F1 is a first schematic representation showing, from a side view, the physical position of the LEDs used in the Multi-Mode Illumination Subsystem, in relation to the image formation lens assembly, the image sensing array employed therein (e.g. a Motorola MCM20027 or National Semiconductor LM9638 CMOS 2-D image sensing array having a 1280�1024 pixel resolution (�″ format), 6 micron pixel size, 13.5 Mhz clock rate, with randomly accessible region of interest (ROI) window capabilities);, 127775\u003dAnother object of the present invention is to provide an Imaging-Based Bar Code Symbol Reader having a Multi-Mode Image-Processing Based Bar Code Symbol Reading Subsystem which operates on captured high-resolution images having an image size of 32768�32768 pixels., 126680\u003dAnother object of the present invention is to provide an Imaging-Based Bar Code Symbol Reader having A Multi-Mode Image-Processing Based Bar Code Symbol Reading Subsystem which decodes UPC/EAN, 1205, C128, C39, C93, CBR omnidirectionally., 674026\u003dIn alternative embodiments of the present invention, illumination arrays 27, 28 and 29 employed within the Multi-Mode Illumination Subsystem 14 may be realized using solid-state light sources other than LEDs, such as, for example, visible laser diode (VLDs) taught in great detail in WIPO Publication No. WO 02/43195 A2, published on May 30, 2002, assigned to Metrologic Instruments, Inc., and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as if set forth fully herein. However, when using VLD-based illumination techniques in the Imaging-Based Bar Code Symbol Reader of the present invention, great care must be taken to eliminate or otherwise substantially reduce speckle-noise generated at the image detection array 22 when using coherent illumination source during object illumination and imaging operations. WIPO Publication No. WO 02/43195 A2, supra, provides diverse methods of and apparatus for eliminating or substantially reducing speckle-noise during image formation and detection when using VLD-based illumination arrays., 291461\u003dAs each image frame always has a frame start signal out of the image sensing array 22, that signal can be used to start the DMA process at address OXAOEC0000, and the address is continuously incremented for the rest of the frame. But the reading of each image frame is started at address OXAOEC0000 to avoid any misalignment of data. Notably, however, if the microprocessor 36 has programmed the CMOS image sensing array 22 to have a ROI window, then the starting address will be modified to (OXAOEC0000+1280 X R1), where R1 is the row number of the top left corner of the ROI., 251267\u003dFIG. 5D1 shows the Lambertian emittance versus wavelength characteristics of the LEDs used to implement the wide area illumination arrays in the illumination subsystem of the present invention. FIG. 5D2 shows the Lambertian emittance versus polar angle characteristics of the LEDs used to implement the near field wide-area illumination arrays in the Multi-Mode Illumination Subsystem 14. FIG. 5D4 is geometrical the layout of LEDs used to implement the narrow wide-area illumination array of the Multi-Mode Illumination Subsystem 14, wherein the illumination beam produced therefrom is aimed by angling the lenses before the LEDs in the near-field wide-area illumination arrays of the Multi-Mode Illumination Subsystem 14. FIG. 5D5 sets forth a set of six illumination profiles for the near-field wide-area illumination fields produced by the near-field wide-area illumination arrays of the illustrative embodiment, taken at 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 100 millimeters along the field away from the imaging window (i.e. working distance) of the Imaging-Based Bar Code Symbol Reader 1. These plots illustrate that the spatial intensity of the near-field wide-area illumination field begins to become substantially uniform at about 40 millimeters (i.e. center:edge\u003d2:1 max).}","textBeforeTable":"Citations de brevets It is understood that the image capture and processing technology employed in bar code symbol reading systems of the illustrative embodiments may be modified in a variety of ways which will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art of having the benefit of the novel teachings disclosed herein.
