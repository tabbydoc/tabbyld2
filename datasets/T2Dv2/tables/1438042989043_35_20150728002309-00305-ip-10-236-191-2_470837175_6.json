Accordingly, this invention should be read broadly in light of the combination of the buoyancy compensator belt 72, the buoyancy compensator 10 and the aspects pertaining thereto in a singular, as well as a combined form. In addition to the foregoing attachment means of the buoyancy compensator belt 72 to the buoyancy compensator 10, various other means such as hooks, eyelets, straps, webs, elastomeric straps, or any other suitable means can be used to allow the buoyancy compensator 10 to be interconnected to the buoyancy compensator belt 72, while at the same time allowing it to expand and contract. The thought being that the buoyancy compensator belt 72 should not be directly adhered to the buoyancy compensator so that there is not give and play between the buoyancy compensator 10 and buoyancy compensator belt 72. Thus, there should be play or give between the two to allow for the expansion and contraction of the buoyancy compensator belt 72 to provide the net result of accommodating the expansion of the buoyancy compensator belt 72.
