Do not use them to identify or resolve performance issues. Ping and traceroute are two of the most useful tools for troubleshooting TCP/IP networking problems. The ping utility generates a series of echo packets to a destination across a TCP/IP internetwork. When the echo packets arrive at the destination, they are rerouted and sent back to the source. Using ping, you can verify connectivity to a particular destination across an IP routed network. The traceroute utility operates in a similar fashion, but can also determine the specific path that a frame takes to its destination on a hop-by-hop basis. These tools have been migrated to Fibre Channel for use with the Cisco MDS 9000 Family switches and are called FC ping and FC traceroute. You can access FC ping and FC traceroute from the CLI or from Fabric Manager.
