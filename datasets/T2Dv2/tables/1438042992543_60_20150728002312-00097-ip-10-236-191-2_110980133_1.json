The IMGT/HLA Database may be accessed via the world wide web at : http://www.ebi.ac.uk/imgt/hla/. Below are listed the newly assigned sequences (Table 1) and confirmations of previously reported sequences (Table 2). The accession number of each sequence is given and these can be used to retrieve the sequence files from either the EMBL, GenBank or DDBJ data libraries. Although accession numbers have been assigned by the data libraries and most sequences are already available, there is still the possibility that an author may not yet have allowed the sequence to be released, in such a case you will have to contact the submitting author directly. Additional information pertaining to new sequences is often included in the publications describing these alleles, a listing of recent publications which describe new HLA sequences is given in Table 3. The following sequences have been submitted to the Nomenclature Committee since the April 2007 nomenclature update and, following agreed policy, have been assigned official allele designations. Full details of all sequences will be published in a forthcoming report.
