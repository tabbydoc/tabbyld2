joined Syntel in Feb 2009 in Pune, spent some nice amount of time there and requested the management to get me back at my home – Mumbai, that is. And in December 2009, I was back to my sweetheart darling mumbai. I used to tell people since I was a kid that in the year of 2010, I will be in USA and here I am today at Denver CO in USA between the Red Rockies. This is called Destiny and of course the Hard Work paid. I am thankful to all the people in my life who helped me and kept me in their prayers always. I know my friends very well, where ever they would be, they would surely be missing me and praying for me on a good note coz I do the same for all of them. Denver is a beautiful place, don’t have car so can’t explore more but its perhaps the only place in USA where you get to see all 4 weathers in a single day. Sun Rises at 6 AM and Sun sets around 9 PM, this is funny but still am loving the fact that small little kid whose name was Amish who always dreamt about this place is sitting in Denver and typing this blog entry., 51387\u003dYeah, the title says it all….too many things in just the span of 2 months…2008 ended up with a bad note and 2009 started with good…those who believe in hard work, dedication, etc. – that’s crap, I have started believing in destiny and am sure you will if you check your past and live in the present., 47025\u003dUrban infrastructure in India is not the best in the world. Indian cities are facing overpopulation, indiscriminate growth and shortage of urban services like public transportation, water supply and sanitation. It is important to point out that the 2006 World-wide Quality of Living Survey by Mercer for 350 global cities has the top Indian cities Mumbai and Delhi ranked at 150th place. Not impressive at all. On the networking front, India ranks 40th out of 115 countries with the network readiness index of 0.23., 53319\u003dI will surely try to write more whenever I find some time outta my work.
