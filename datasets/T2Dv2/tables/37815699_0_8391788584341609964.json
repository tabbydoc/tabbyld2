Katherine Dexter McCormick was one of Sanger\u0027s friends and a philanthropist. He was the one to provide financial aid to Pincus, who gathered a team of scientists to work on the creation of a hormone-based substance, which would be able to imitate pregnancy. The work of Picus on the pill caught the attention of one of the most popular supporters of birth control in the United States at that time, Margaret Sanger. Besides his contribution to developing the pill, Pincus also studied the biochemistry of aging, arthritis, cancer, as well as the reaction of the adrenal system to stress.","textAfterTable":"Curiosities events funny News Banks and Finances Business - Economy New Technologies Politics Science Username: * Password: * Create","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":1,"headerRowIndex":0}
