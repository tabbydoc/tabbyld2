Submitted by Anonymous on Thu, 07/07/2011 - 20:47. I dont want to sit around watching someone aim a wand at someone and say a spell, thats retarded.

Ok for the person that said Harry Potter wont be remembered in 10 years. You are SO BEYOND wrong.

So trust and believe it will be remembered even longer than anyone","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":1,"headerRowIndex":0}
