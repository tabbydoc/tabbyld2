We asked consumers how satisfied they are with their recent customer service experiences on a 7-point scale from (1) very dissatisfied to (7) very satisfied. We take the percentage of consumers that gave a rating of 6 or 7 and subtract the percentage that gave a rating of 1, 2, or 3. This results in a ?net satisfaction? rating for each of the three elements. For more information, see the?Temkin Customer Service Ratings Overview.
