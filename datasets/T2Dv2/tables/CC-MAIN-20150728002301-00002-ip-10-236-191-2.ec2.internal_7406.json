Uncle BOb\u0027s was generous to donate a storage space for our 501c3 non-profit (The Adventurers Academy of Lifelong Learning) to store garage sale items for a month for a GIANT sale in March. We were allowed an extra month to get rid of items that were left over. We are hoping that we will be able to get a little more time BEFORE our sale and maybe a room up from a 10X10 for next year so that we can collect more large items.
