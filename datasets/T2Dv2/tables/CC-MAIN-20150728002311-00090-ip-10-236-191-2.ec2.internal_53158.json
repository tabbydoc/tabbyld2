The two first years were mainly devoted to the prospecting of historical localities, some discovered and/or exploited by Dmitry Obruchev himself.

Novgorod and Leningrad Regions are topographically excessively flat. Devonian fields have not been disrupted by tectonic movements and the layers are thus horizontal. Rocks are most often quite unconsolidated (consisting of loose sands or clays) and excavations are thus relatively easy. The lack of relief and the vegetal cover unfortunately lead to few outcrops in the landscape. They are all located along rivers (Lovat’, Syas\u0027 and Oredesh rivers for instance) or are represented by outliers. Although most of the localities were easily accessible by cars, others required several kilometers by feet and/or by boat. Roughly 30 localities have been prospected. About one third of them are very interesting such as Borshovo and Goryn\u0027 (Luga District) which provided numerous and exquisite fossils of placoderms, agnathans and sarcopterygians. The original locality of the Frasnian tetrapod Obruchevichthys in Russia, Sondala (Leningrad Region), has been rediscovered with near certainty.","RFBR ; CNRS","Origin, ecology and environments of the earliest tetrapods from the Upper Devonian (Frasnian) and paleogeography in the Eastern \"Old Red Sandstone Continent\".","Researchers ; Professionals ; Students","http://hdl.handle.net/2268/103909"]],"pageTitle":"ORBi: Olive Sébastien - 2009-2010 Russo-franco-latvian expeditions in the Main Devonian Field (North-western Russia)","title":"","url":"http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/103909","hasHeader":false,"headerPosition":"NONE","tableType":"ENTITY","tableNum":2,"s3Link":"common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042991019.80/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002311-00090-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz","recordEndOffset":180287303,"recordOffset":180279101,"tableOrientation":"HORIZONTAL","textBeforeTable":"Reference : 2009-2010 Russo-franco-latvian expeditions in the Main Devonian Field (North-western ...
