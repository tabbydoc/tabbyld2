I guess if Goldman's involvement turned out to be as bad as I fear, it can be explained by them finding holes in the regulation where they were the only dominant player. They were able to act (as in the foot market) with no one challenging their doings. No regulation, no competition meaning they were able to game the system as they pleased.<p>Somehow I hope all this information about Goldman's involvement is correct, because it would give clear directions on how to fix the macroeconomic problems the world (not just America) faces. It would clearly show how to adjust the legal system, enforcement.",1305161991

I have my place in society and I'm not about to start over in life and become a politician just to fix my perceived problem with the system. No more than I would start over and become a doctor because I thought that, say, doctors had bad attitudes. I'll vote the appropriate way but that's really my only recourse. I still have the right to bitterly complain about rampant corruption in politics and even be pessimistic about reform happening.<p>> There exist honest, well-meaning, hard-working people working in government and politics to attempt to fix these issues. Unfortunately they're outnumbered by people like you, who tar all of them with same brush you use for the most corrupt business lobbyist.<p>I don't see how the OP's attitude affects the good people working to fix the issues.

David Bois won his anti-trust case against Microsoft, and then proposed a penalty that was a slap on the wrist.  He turned around, and then was handed an endless stream of revenue from the SCO case.  There is evidence that said legal proceeding was funded behind the scenes by Microsoft.  Coincidence?  I think not.<p>As for the argument that I said you would face, I didn't make it up.  That is the bog standard argument that is always trotted out to support the standard practice of having regulators come from, and then return to, the industries that they regulate.  In practice people really do get swayed by the argument that a person who knows the industry is at an advantage in understanding it well enough to get involved in regulation.  Either that or they pretend to be while accepting donations, but it works out to the same thing in the end.",1305161750
2539090,comment,2538565,2538814,5,0,pstack,,,"I know it's not quite the same thing, but wasn't there a ""startup"" of sorts awhile back that focused on exposing documented evidence of different levels of corporate and government corruption? I can't remember what it was called, but I'm pretty sure the guy behind it had to flee the country and was charged with several counts of rape and a lot of the people he was trying to expose the information <i>to</i> about their own government said that they wanted him executed.<p>Anyway, there are certainly already-existing entities that serve the public good, but government corruption isn't irrelevant as long as there is government corruption. You can benefit social good all you like, but how exactly is it going to wholly displace the existence, expense, and function of a government office or committee?<p>The FDA example. Or the Goldman Sachs example. How are you going to displace the need for the FDA to exist or for the SEC and the Treasury to exist? Or the need for the military industrial complex? These are all functions that seemingly need to exist and be performed for the good of the people. The problem is that they require oversight. The public needs to be aware of the corruption and given the power to do something about it and it seems we either don't or won't. (And I'm part of that group, because if I knew how to change it, I would).<p>It is so massive. So complex. So layered. And so corrupt. I really almost can't expect someone busy trying to keep a roof over their head and their children clothed and educated to somehow be aware of many of these corruptions, much less have a way to change it (beyond the trivialities of voting, which mostly seems to just serve us as a way to make us feel better about ourselves).<p>When we have lots of regulation, we're told that the solution is to deregulate and then industries are singularly corrupt. When we don't have enough regulation, we're told the solution is to regulate. Then the regulator positions are staffed with people from the companies being regulated and corruption is there.<p>If there <i>are</i> some great solutions, I'm all ears. :)",1305161712

What I do know is that Chrome & ChromeOS have got some of the most diligent security-minded hackers in the world working on them.  I get occasional updates on the stuff they are doing to make Chrome secure.  Things like the sandbox, SPDY, HSTS and more.  This sort of thing will just motivate them to work smarter & harder.",1305158724

2538962,comment,2538037,2538833,4,0,haberman,,,"That's deep man, but I posed an actual question.<p>BigTable (which I use daily and have extensive experience with) offers atomic and transactional updates at the row level.  It uses Paxos to guarantee that at most one process at a time owns each row and can mutate it.  That process keeps a sequential log that imposes an absolute order over updates to that row.<p>So it appears to me that despite being a NoSQL database, BigTable rows offer both ACID and the ""C"" of CAP.  In fact, I bet it would be possible to implement a MySQL backend that uses a BigTable row as its storage.<p>I get strlen's point that C != C (it's more analogous to A/I), but my real point is that NoSQL (at least in the case of BigTable) doesn't appear to be fundamentally different than SQL in the offered guarantees, but rather in the granularity at which those guarantees are offered.  NoSQL just takes the traditional one-single-ACID-entity model (a SQL database) and breaks it apart into lots of little ACID entities called rows/keys/documents/etc.<p>CAP of course applies to both SQL and NoSQL equally.",1305158582
