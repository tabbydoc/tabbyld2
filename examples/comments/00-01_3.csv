It's not just about control and money; these matter, but less than you think.<p>By choosing AT&T, Apple chose GSM, which gave the iPhone compatibility with most of the world. They looked at CDMA and realized that it was a dead-end technology; they looked at the expense of having to maintain two different radio chipsets; they looked at a lot of things and made the decision that, at least up until now, they didn't want to deal with it. Apple has relationships with three GSM carriers in Canada (Rogers/Fido, Bell, and Telus) and many more elsewhere in the world. If T-Mobile had used the more common GSM frequencies, Apple might not have gone with an exclusive deal with AT&T. Maybe.<p>On the other hand, my immediate reaction on seeing the story title was ""who is Brad Feld and why should I care that he's switching?""<p>Seriously. Looking at his CrunchBase profile, I can see that he does VC stuff now and built a fairly large consulting company, but I am still not sure that I should care about his opinions about consumer electronics. So I <i>do</i> think that his opinion has less merit because he got this particular device for free. (Money isn't credibility. To me, he's just some random guy with a platform. A blogger with no relevance to anything that I do.)<p>IMO, a consumer who has loyalty to a particular device or technology is a fool. If someone really comes up with something that I can unequivocally say is better than my iPhone, I will switch. So far, Android is ""close but no cigar"".",1274402345

You better have a really, really good reason to do so--and those emails better provide significant value to your users, otherwise they will opt out, possibly even report as spam.<p>I don't know what business you are in, but only certain businesses can really get away with sending that much email--ie Groupon, Gilt, etc.--and that is because those emails provide a lot of value and meet a lot of needs.  If you fall in the category of a business who can send that much email awesome!<p>If possible I think it is best to use a tiered, opt-in subscription model.  Some example tiers:  ""Daily Deals Beat"", ""Weekly Rundown"", ""2-Week Summary"", and ""Monthly Newsletter""(these names suck I know).  You can present these options as part of the sign-up process, or better yet, when they click the sign up confirmation email take them to a settings to opt-in to the various tiers.  This is also good to have as the landing page for when someone clicks unsubscribe in your email.  Take them to this settings page where they can adjust the level of contact, or unsubscribe completely, that is right for them.  If you are sending one message a day chances are you will have a lot of people hitting that unsubscribe link, and some might not want to totally discontinue contact so give them options to adjust as well as totally unsubscribe.<p>Sidenote:  Mediapost has an awesome publication called Email Insider, if you plan on sending that much email you might want to be reading this.  <a href=""http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?art_type=32&fa=Archives.showArchive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?art_type=32&fa=Ar...</a>",1274401118

But even if it does not rule it out there definitely is something going on here, which is why there will have to be some more study. The surprising thing to me is that they could find any evidence at all, instead of no differences between people with and without the burn-out symptoms.<p>After all for a variety of psychological disorders there is no objective difference between a 'healthy' and a 'diseased' brain that we can nail down, to find one in this instance is an indication that there might be some clear underlying cause.<p>As long as that cause has not been found it's somewhat speculative but my guess is that if they can nail it down so clearly that a cause will one day be found.",1274400563

The problem is that a set of brain states may have different ""causes"" -- and causation get's really tricky here but that's another story.<p>For example, the measured brain states associated with burn out could be do to a chemical deficiency (either in diet or genetic), or be because the person worked a long day at work, or perhaps could be a result of the person staying up very late playing video games. Most people would agree that the first is a disease state, but what about the second? The third?<p>Finally, with respect to their finding that burnout was associated with smaller potentials, assuming that they made their measurements using fMRI[1], then they were measuring changes in blood flow, which in turn are putatively reflective of the metabolic activity of nearby neurons, which in turn is putatively reflective of their frequency of excitation, averaged over some interval. There <i>are</i> circumstances where the magnitude of individual action potentials are affected, but I strongly doubt that is what they are talking about here, not the least because I don't see how they could measure it.<p>1. If they instead used EEG, I can make a similar argument that they are still measuring frequency of excitation.",1274400161
