1938989,comment,1938504,1938504,0,0,_delirium,,,"One hypothesis (not sure if it's correct) is that there isn't actually as much of a matching problem as people think, but instead more of a supply problem. When you're a lonely open-source developer who can't find a second or third contributor, if this hypothesis is right, then it's not because they're out there, itching to write code, but unable to find your project in the noise of the web. Rather, it's because they don't exist, or their time is already spoken for. If that's true, a matching marketplace will just result in a bunch of unanswered want ads from lonely open-source developers, because the supply of willing hands is already taken. At best, it'll result in a zero-sum switching of developers from some projects to others.<p>It seems for that scenario not to be the case, either: 1) there has to be a bunch of unused latent supply due to a real matching problem, i.e. lots of people who <i>would</i> contribute but cannot find anything to contribute to; or 2) the existence of such a site would have to actually increase supply itself, perhaps if it generated a bunch of positive PR and reached previously unengaged people.",1290646170

Just because both schizophrenia and artistic temperament are characterised by ""unusual cognition"" doesn't mean that they're related. Being drunk is like being a lemur in that they both prohibit you from driving a car, but it doesn't follow that drunkenness and lemurness are related.",1290644255
