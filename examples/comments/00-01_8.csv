I think there are a few advantages to the latter approach though. JIT is never going to beat carefully hand-optimized code, and the amount of code that needs such optimization is small.

If you follow through from the top to the blog, there is authors reasoning:<p><i>Introducing Rusthon<p>Rust is a systems programming language, and too low level for quick prototyping, or simple web backends. It is nice to have all of the low level control so you can fine tune performance later, but it should be optional. Rusthon is a high level Python-like language that compiles to Rust. Rusthon started as a fork of Gython, which is a fork of PythonJS.<p>The goal of Rusthon is simple and clean syntax inspired by Python. Rusthon will allow you to code at a higher level than normal Rust code, and interoperate well with hand written Rust and the Rust libraries. You can start off writting your application in Rusthon, and drop down to hand written Rust where you need more performance.</i><p><a href=""http://rusthon-lang.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rusthon-lang.blogspot.com/</a>",1419208405
