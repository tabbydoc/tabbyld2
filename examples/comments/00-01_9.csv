But if you consider the whole group or species in the long run, the effect you see is exactly what you describe, i.e. groups that encourage this kind of behavior will outcompete groups that don't. So for a species to survive, it is much more important that the group survives than just an individual. If the individual survives, but it can't reproduce, then the species won't survive in the long term.<p>I think the important thing is to determine what behavior better represents reality, meaning what would explain the survival of current species on earth, not just try to confirm survival of the fittest for an individual.",1306197537

2578191,comment,2577095,2578169,21,0,grellas,,,"Apple likely can sue Lodsys for declaratory relief if Lodsys persists in its claims against developers. This would be an action by Apple against Lodsys seeking a court judgment that its license covers the challenged activities and a related declaration that no infringement exists by reason of such activities. Developers clearly benefit from any such action by Apple but this is a little different from committing to hold the developers themselves harmless from any legal action. A ""hold harmless"" would mean that Apple commits to defend any developer who is sued and, further, agrees to pay any damages suffered should that developer be found to infringe. Since Apple has not yet committed to do this (indeed, I believe its contract terms say that it will not do this), in theory, the developers might still be sued and have to defend their individual cases even if Apple does bring a declaratory relief lawsuit against Lodsys. Of course, a court in any such action might act to consolidate the various lawsuits and stay those brought against the developers pending resolution of Apple's primary suit. My point is not that developers are not helped by Apple's stance, as they plainly are. It is only to state that Apple has not yet committed to cover them against all harm here, regardless of what Lodsys might do. Apple might choose to take this further step as events develop but the letter as worded is more guarded than that. I think Apple is waiting to see if the <i>in terrorem</i> effect of its letter will solve this before considering further options.",1306197394

My preference on most things is matte - I always opted for matte when people printed photos from something called ""film.""<p>Here's why glossy screens are better, for me anyway:<p>1) It's better in sunlight. Counterintuitive I know, but it's far, far better. Matte screens diffract light and render the screen unreadable. Glossy screens can be made visible either passively (in very strong light) or actively if the screen is bright enough (as many now are.)<p>2) Glare is controllable and not diffused on a glossy screen. With a matte screen, glare manifests as blobs, and spread across the screen. With a glossy screen, glare is localized and easily defeated by repositioning the screen.<p>3) Matte makes screens less bright. It's a translucent filter, so of course it reflects and absorbs light.<p>4) Matte filters can be added, but a matte screen can't be made glossy.<p>The real solution: get rid of awful overhead florescent lighting. Ok, not that easy for most of you, but I think Steve Jobs probably wants those gone as much as he wants Flash gone. Any word on lighting at Apple?",1306195439

Also, they don't have _every_ network (no CBS, for example - or Sci-Fi either, if I recall). Missing plenty of others.

The more related X is to something, the more willing X is to sacrifice itself for it. The most extreme example is also the most familiar: each of your cells has DNA identical to each of your other cells (if all is well). So a cell is completely willing to kill itself for the ""collective"", even at the expense of its own ability to reproduce.  A less extreme example is that of a woman declining to pursue kids of her own in order to help tend her sister's, which could be adaptive when, e.g., food is scarce.<p>Group selection: members of a particular group (e.g., a tribe) are willing to engage in altruistic actions (e.g., suicidal defense of said tribe pre-procreation) even though doing so maladaptive at the level of the individual's DNA. This kind of cooperation is adaptive for the group as a whole, but not in the least for the individual. Groups that encourage this kind of behavior will outcompete groups that don't, so groups are selected for this trait.<p>IIRC, the primary reason that group selection is thought to be wrong is that it (apparently) can't yield an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) -- it will always be better for the persistence of any individual's DNA if that individual refuses to be altruistic.",1306195206
